# Ion Engine
Ion Engine is a DirectX C++ based game engine that was developed by Ian Klask while attending DePaul University for his undergrad.

In this repository there are four main folders:
  - Dependant Libraries:  Includes libraries crucial for IonEngine to run (File, Math, DirectXTex)
  - IonCore:  Static library for the DirectX 11 based graphics core and game loop
  - IonEngine:  Static library for the main Engine
  - Example Project: A visual studio example project using IonEngine to make a simple 3D tank game
  
More information on how to use the engine can be found at the engine's documantation site:
